# Module-4


Hello World!!!

This is Alex. I am here to show you some examples of different programs 
that had mistakes for them and what I did to fix them. In each of the differnet programs,
I was able to show what I did to make the program run the way it was supposed to run. 
In each of the different programs, you can enter a differnet number or word to be able 
to have a statement print. Each of them are different and have differnt statements. 

From,
Alex
